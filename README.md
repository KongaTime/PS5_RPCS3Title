# RPCS3

A PS5 homebrew title (`PPSA99200`) on RADV, made from the
[PS5 Vulkan Template](https://github.com/mihawk-99/PS5_VulkanTemplate) foundation at
`f827f0a5`: Sascha Willems' Vulkan example base class with its PS5 hooks, the PS5 layer
(the launch, the pad, klog, test runs, the build and the console tools), and one
program, `examples/rpcs3/rpcs3.cpp`, grown from the starter sample.

**The title runs RPCS3, the PlayStation 3 emulator, in place of that program**: see
[`rpcs3/README.md`](rpcs3/README.md) for how it is built, what works and what does not,
and why its builds are for your own console only. The sections below are the
foundation's, about the starter program it still carries.

## Building and running

It builds against my PS5 stack, checked out beside it: PS5_Vulkan (the RADV release
archive, the link recipe, the native tool and `libc.prx`) and the payload SDK fork
(`ps5/tools/setup-sdk.sh` installs it at the pinned revision).

```bash
ps5/tools/build.sh              # dist/PPSA99200/: eboot.bin, sce_sys, shaders, assets
ps5/tools/deploy.sh             # upload what changed, over the console's FTP server
ps5/tools/run.sh                # a test run: 300 frames, the last one saved and checked
ps5/tools/run.sh --menu         # no test: the program, until it ends itself
ps5/tools/host-reference.sh     # the same frames on this PC's Vulkan driver
```

A launch from the home screen starts the program at once. The sticks move the camera,
OPTIONS or the touch pad shows and hides the settings window, the D-pad and CROSS
change them, and its Quit ends the title.

## Growing it

- **The program** is one class on the base class, `examples/rpcs3/rpcs3.cpp`, with its
  shaders in `shaders/glsl/rpcs3/` (GLSL beside the SPIR-V it loads: after changing one,
  `ps5/tools/compile-shaders.sh rpcs3`).
- **A technique from the template's samples** (shadows, deferred lighting, bloom, MSAA,
  instancing, indirect draws, compute, bindless textures, mesh shaders, ray queries)
  copies across as it stands: every sample is a class on the same base.
- **Assets** go in `ps5/assets.json`, each with its origin and licence; only assets
  with a clear licence are shipped (`ps5/ASSETS.md` is written from it).
- **More programs**: another `SAMPLE(...)` line in `ps5/src/samples.cpp` turns the
  title into a menu of them, as Vulkan Template is.
- How the foundation works, its test runs and its tools: PS5_VulkanTemplate's
  `ps5/README.md`; the agent skills for this stack are in its `skills/`.

## Licences

The foundation is MIT (`LICENSE.md`, Sascha Willems'; the PS5 layer is mine, under the
same licence). The assets keep their own (`ps5/ASSETS.md`). The built title links the
PS5 platform layer of my payload SDK fork, which is GPL-3.0, so the title as
distributed is under GPL-3.0.
